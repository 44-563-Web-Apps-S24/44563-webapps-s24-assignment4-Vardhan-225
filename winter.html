let me in. They said you were busy. Well, what was I to do. If you're
busy, you're busy, and I'm in no hurry. </p>

<p class = "speech"> Oh, my dear old man, how strangely life
changes, and how it deceives! To-day, out of sheer boredom, I took up
this book--old university lectures, and I couldn't help laughing. My
God, I'm secretary of the local district council, the council which has
Protopopov for its chairman, yes, I'm the secretary, and the summit of
my ambitions is--to become a member of the council! I to be a member
of the local district council, I, who dream every night that I'm a
professor of Moscow University, a famous scholar of whom all Russia is
proud!</p>
