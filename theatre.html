    <h2>THE THREE SISTERS by Anton Checkov</h2>

    <h3>Act 2</h3>

    <h4><b>ANDREY.</b></h4>
    <p>I was just thinking.... There is really nothing to say....</p>

    <h4><b>NATASHA.</b></h4>
    <p>Yes... there was something I wanted to tell you.... Oh, yes.
        Ferapont has come from the Council offices, he wants to see you.</p>

    <h4><b>ANDREY.</b></h4>
    <p>[Yawns]</p> 
    <p>him here.</p> 
    <p>[NATASHA goes out; ANDREY reads his book, stooping over the candle she
    has left behind. FERAPONT enters; he wears a tattered old coat with the
    scollar up. His ears are muffled.]</p>

    <h4><b>ANDREY.</b></h4>
    <p>Good morning, grandfather. What have you to say?</p>

    <h4><b>FERAPONT.</b></h4>
    <p> The Chairman sends a book and some documents or other.
        Here....</p>
    <p>[Hands him a book and a packet.]</p>

    <h4><b>ANDREY.</b></h4>
    <p>Thank you. It's all right. Why couldn't you come earlier? It's
        past eight now.</p>

    <h4><b>FERAPONT</b></h4>
    <p>What?</p>

    <h4><b>ANDREY.</b></h4>
    <p>[Louder]</p>
    <p>say you've come late, it's past eight.</p>
